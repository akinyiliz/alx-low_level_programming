# 0x00. C - Hello, World
In this project, I learnt about compilation of C files using `gcc` and text-printing functions in C.

## Tasks
**0. Preprocessor**
  * Bash script that runs a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and saves the result in an output file `c`. - [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor).

**1. Compiler**
  * Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` but does not link; the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`. - [1-compiler](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler).

**2. Assembler**
  * Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable `$CFILE`; the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`. - [2-assembler](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler).

**3. Name**
  * Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable named `cisfun`. - [3-name](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name).
 
**4. Hello, puts**
  * C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the function `puts`. - [4-puts.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c).

**5. Hello, printf**
  * C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art`, followed by a new line, using function `printf`. - [5-printf.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c).

**6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
  * C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. - [6-size.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c).

**7. Intel**
  * Bash script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`; saves the result in an output file of the same name but with the extension `.s`. - [100-intel](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel).

**8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**
  * C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed b a new line, to the standard error, without using any functions listed in the `NAME` section of the man(3)`printf` or man(3)`puts`. - [101-quote.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c).
