# C - Variables, if, else, while
In this project, I learned various operators in C, declaring and defining variables of different types and also using `if...else` staements and `while` loops.

## Tasks
**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c): C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line:
     - Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c).
     - Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
     - Prints the number followed by `is positive` if the number is greater than 0, `is zero` if the number is zero,
       or `is negative` if the number is less than 0.

**1. The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c): C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
      - Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c).
      - Stores a different value every time the program is run.
      - Prints the string `Last digit of` [number] `is` [last_digit] `and is` followed by `greater than 5` 
        if the digit is greater than 5, `0` if the digit is 0, or `less than 6 and not 0` 
        if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.

**2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c): C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function twice.

**3. alphABET**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c): C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using only `putchar` function three times.

**4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c): C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function three times.

**5. Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

**6. Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function twice without any variables of type `char`.

**7. Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c): C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function twice.

**8. Hexadecimal**
  * [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c): C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed ny a new line, using the `putchar` function three times.

**9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c): C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function four times without any variables of type `char`:
    - Numbers are separated by ,, followed by a space.
    - Numbers are printed in ascending order.

**10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c): C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the `putchar` function five times without any variables of type `char`:
    - Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
    - The two digits are different.
    - `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits 
      `0` and `1`.
    - Prints only the smallest combination of two digits.
    - Numbers are printed in ascending order.

**11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
   * [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c): C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits using only the `putchar` function six times without any variables of type `char`:
      - Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
      - The three digits are different.
      - `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201` and `210` are considered the 
        same combination of the three digits `0`, `1` and `2`.
      - Prints only the smallest combination of three digits.
      - Numbers are printed in ascending order.

**12. Software is eating the World**
  * [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/akinyiliz/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c): C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers using only the `putchar` function eight times without any variables of type `char`:
      - Numbers range from `0` to `99`.
      - Two numbers are separated by a space.
      - Numbers are printed with two digits [ie. `1` is printed as `01`].
      - `00 01` and `01 00` are considered the same as the combination of 
         the numbers `0` and `1`.
      - Combinations of numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
      - Combinations of numbers are printed in ascending order.
